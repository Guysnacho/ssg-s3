# Static Site Generation (SSG) meets AWS S3

  - If changes in AWS package, apply tf apply first
  - Put [plan and apply](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-script#welcome-a-first-time-contributor) to PR
  - Deploy static package
- Look into [atmos](https://atmos.tools/) for environments
